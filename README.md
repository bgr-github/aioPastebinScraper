# Asynchronous Pastebin Scraper

There are two arguments when running this file from the command line.

**-t** is timeout in seconds. Default is 15.

**-l** is loop time in seconds. Default is 10 (I don't recommend anything lower than that.)

Example usage: *python3 scraper.py -t 15 -l 10*

TO INSTALL:
*pip install -r requirements.txt*
