As a goddess, Hina has always been; she always existed. Quite a notable amount of time ago, Hina simply wandered around, and collected seldomly the misfortune of humans. Unlike other goddesses, she was always one of these godesses, the one everyone associated to bad things. Humans can feel that Hina is surrounded by misfortune, and thus think of her as a bad goddess everytime she comes in sight. Unlike Minoriko Aki who brings harvest for example, removing misfortune is not something that is noticed by mundane beings and it being around her doesn’t help her case.

Over time, Hina became somewhat fond of humans, since they are her greatest source of misfortune. The more time passed, the more she enjoyed seeing humans happy after she removed their bad luck. After a while, she decided to protect humans as well, realizing she preferred them alive. A dead human is not an happy human. Thus she took on the duty to protect humans, even though her methods are often questionable.

She is more often seen nowadays trying to chase away humans from dangerous areas.
